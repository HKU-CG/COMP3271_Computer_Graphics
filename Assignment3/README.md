# Programming Assignment 2
## Due date: 23:59, Nov. 7, 2024 HKT

### Goal
Shaders in OpenGL.

### Objectives
- You are required to implement a simple shader program in OpenGL.

### Code Template
- You will be offered a template, so you don’t need to do more work to configure the template.
- The template has already implemented some initial work, such as initializing one window, configuring
OpenGL and so on.
- Only two .glsl files are provided in the template. You need to fill in the shaders in these two files.
- Feel free to use your own environment and library. But you should schedule a meeting and demo your
  program to the TA.

### Usage
#### Linux/Macos
```shell
$ cd COMP3271_Computer_Graphics/Assignment2
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ ./Main
```
#### Windows (PowerShell)
```shell
$ cd COMP3271_Computer_Graphics/Assignment2
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
```

Then open Assignment2.sln under `build` folder, set Main as Startup Projects.

### Task
Your task is to implement the main function in `fragment_shader.glsl` and `vertex_shader.glsl`.

Refer to the tutorial slides for more details

### Requirements

One window should be opened to show the required interactive techniques with related functions. See the
demo video for reference.

Necessary comments to explain your code is required.

**Submit your work `fragment_shader.glsl` and `vertex_shader.glsl` (If other files are modified, please also submit them) on Moodle before the deadline.**
