## Instruction

### Environment Setup

#### Macos
- Install Homebrew using the following commands
```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

- Install cmake, make, git, glfw(We need install glfw here because the code didn't provide static library for ARM for now)
```shell
brew install cmake make glfw git
```
#### Linux

- Use your package manager to install cmake, build-essential(This is a meta package that contains the tools we need for compiling cxx projects)
```shell
sudo apt install cmake build-essential
```

#### Windows

- Download and install [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com), "Desktop development with c++" should also be installed.
- Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Cmake](https://cmake.org)
- Alternatively git and cmake can be installed with winget
```shell
winget install Git.Git
winget install cmake
```
